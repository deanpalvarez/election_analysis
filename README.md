# Election Analysis Challenge with Python
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to utilize Python to extract and summarize voting data found in an extremely large dataset, by displaying the summarized outcomes to be used as seen fit. From nearly 400,000 ballots, we were able to determine both the desired percentage/number of votes for each candidate found, but also from each county the votes came from.
## Results of Election Audit:
##### Voting results by county:
-	Denver was the county with the highest voter turnout, the exact breakdown for all counties is as follows:
```
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
```
##### Voting results by candidate:
-	The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, the exact breakdown for all candidates is all follows:
```
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
```
### **369,711 total votes were cast in the election.**

## Summary of Analysis
As displayed above, the coding utilized with the Python script allowed us to extract very key information about this election, while specifically noting the shear size of the data presented. The above information was able to be found in a relatively short amount of time, with just the pressing of a few buttons. This script can easily be reused, modified, and refined for future campaigns of a variety of sizes and types of data. This can be done simply by adding loops/conditional statements to accommodate additional data (such as age/income) and utilizing commenting (#) to explain/simplify the process to whoever is handling the information.
